# Git and Markdown
I have learned how to use a open-source Markup Language. I have used VS code to make a file. It is very useful to work with MarkDown. MarkDown is What You See Is What You Mean (WYSIWYM) way of working. You only have to write the text and GitHub in this case will make the lay-out.   

## Key terminology
- MarkDown: MarkDown is What You See Is What You Mean (WYSIWYM) way of working. You only have to write the text and GitHub in this case will make the lay-out. Is is very easy to use because you don't have to have any knowledge of coding. 
- What You See Is What You Mean (WYSIWYM):The end result of a written document is shown as you see on your screen without the code to describe it. You only need to write the words, but the lay-out will be made by for example GitHub. 
- What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG): what you see (type) on your screen is how the output will be shown. This includes the complete lay-out: Marked words, Lettersize etc.

### Overcome challenges
-  At the beginning it was quite hard to understand the difference between WYSUWYG and WYSIWYM. But after some input form my teammates and some online searching I found the answer. 
- I also didn't know which MarkDown editor to use but all my teammates use VS Code, so I also used that editor. 
- After I made the md File I had some issues with the working directory but that was quickly fixed after some help from my teammates.

### Results
I have made a md File with the VS code editor.
