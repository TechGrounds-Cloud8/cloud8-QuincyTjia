# LNX-02 Files and Directories
Today I have learned how to make a SSH connection to my machine. You need a key to log in, this was generated by AWS. After I logged in I had to type in whoami to see if I was logged in.

## Key terminology
- SSH: SSH is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate and share data. It is often used to login and perform operations on remote computers. 
- PEM file: A PEM file is a container file used to store cryptographic keys. It can be used to represent all types of data but is often used to encode keyfiles ues for SSH.

### Overcome challanges
- I was stuck for quite a while because I couldn't login. After a while we found out that we couldn't login because we didn't had access to the right ports. 

### Results
I have logged in and I am ready to work on the VM.
