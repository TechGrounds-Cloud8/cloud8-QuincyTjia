## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I added the certificate, assets directory, did a lot of troubleshooting.
 
## Obstacles

I didn't know an error within the code and I didn't know which domain name to use for the certificate.

## Solutions

After some tips from the LC's and teammates, I managed to figure out what to do. The error had to do with an array which I didn't used and the for the domain name, I needed to use a wildcard.

## Learnings

I learned how to use a certificate and code it, and how wildcard work.
