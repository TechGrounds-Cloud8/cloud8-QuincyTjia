# NTW-06 Subnetting

## Key terminology
- LAN: A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school. 
- Host: Every device (host) within a LAN  
- Subnet: A smaller network within your bigger network.
- Subnet mask (prefix): Every device has an IP address with two pieces: the client or host address and the server or network address. IP addresses are either configured by a DHCP server or manually configured (static IP addresses). The subnet mask splits the IP address into the host and network addresses, thereby defining which part of the IP address belongs to the device and which part belongs to the network. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s. In this way, the subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host addresses.
- CIDR notation: Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) is a set of Internet protocol (IP) standards that is used to create unique identifiers for networks and individual devices. The IP addresses allow particular information packets to be sent to specific computers. CIDR IP addresses consist of two groups of numbers, which are also referred to as groups of bits. The most important of these groups is the network address, and it is used to identify a network or a sub-network (subnet). The lesser of the bit groups is the host identifier. The host identifier is used to determine which host or device on the network should receive incoming information packets.  
- Subnet calculator: The subnet calculator is a handy tool for finding the number of possible subnets for any given network address block. You can choose the combination of subnets and number of hosts per subnet that suits your network and get the host address range and broadcast address for any given subnet mask.

### Overcome challenges
- I first had to search up what all the key terminology mean.  
- After that I had to find out how a Network Architecture could look like.
- After that I needed to find out what is in our network system and how to make subnets.
- 

### Results
