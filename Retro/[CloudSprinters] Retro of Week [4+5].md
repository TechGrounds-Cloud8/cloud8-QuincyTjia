# [CloudSprinters] Retro of Week [4+5]
## What went well?
 - Making rules at the beginning of the sprint
 - The group atmosphere was bad at the beginning but in the end the atmosphere was very good
 - Time management went very well
 - The daily standups were better than the week before

## What could have gone better?
 - Following the rules
 - Timeboxing for help
 - The daily standups could have been a bit shorter
 - Ask specific questions instead of vague ones

## What can we do to improve?
 - Repeat the rules and make it clear that you have to stick to the rules
 - The one who needs help has to plan the help timebox (moment)
 - Keep the daily standups to work related only
