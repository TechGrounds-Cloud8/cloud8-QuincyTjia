## Daily Report (1 sentence)

Today I continued the CDK workshop and I completed it untill writing constructs. 
 
## Obstacles

I didn't quit understand what CDK actually is. I also had some troubles with understanding some steps.
 
## Solutions

I googled some more about CDK and watched some youtube videos to. I also asked Ben (teammate) some help for some steps.
 
## Learnings
 I learned how to use CDK and how to deploy and destroy a stack etc. from the workshop.
