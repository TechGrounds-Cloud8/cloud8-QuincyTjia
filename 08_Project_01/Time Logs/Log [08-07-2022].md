I managed to complete the code for VPC peering enabling and started on the code for the EC2 servers.
 
## Obstacles

I couldn't find the solution on the code for VPC peering.  
 
## Solutions

I searched a lot finding out how to get it working. Then it turned out it had to do with my knowledge of python coding. I had to use object-oriented programming (OOP). 

## Learnings
I learned what OOP is and how it works. I also learned how to enable VPC peering and how to deploy EC2 instances.
