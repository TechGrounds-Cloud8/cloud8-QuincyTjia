Today I finished the CDK workshop and I began writing the code to deploy a VPC.  
 
## Obstacles

I had no idea how to deploy a VPC using CDK. After deployment I found out it had deployed 4 subnets instead of 2.
 
## Solutions

I searched for examples on how to deploy a VPC and find something that explained it very wel. The solution for deploying 2 subnets instead of 4 will be fixed tomorrow.
 
## Learnings
