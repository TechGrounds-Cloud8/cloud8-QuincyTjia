## Daily Report (1 sentence)

Today I have placed the user stories in Jira and I began with the CDK workshop.
 
## Obstacles

It was difficult to make the user stories and tasks smaller to understand them better. The project document was a bit overwhelming at the beginning. 
 
## Solutions

I read the document a few times and made some notes. After that I had a much better understanding of the project. I also made the document a bit smaller with only the information I need.
 
## Learnings
 I learned how to use Jira and how to make user stories. I also learned a bit already on how to use CDK.
