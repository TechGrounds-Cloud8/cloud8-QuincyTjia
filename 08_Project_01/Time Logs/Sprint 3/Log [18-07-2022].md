## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I managed to add permissions to the S3 bucket and I started working on the SSH connection from a trusted IP.
 
## Obstacles

I didn't know how to add permissions and when I changed the IP from any IP to my own, I couldn't connect via SSH anymore. 

## Solutions

I found out I had to change the permissions of the S3 Bucket instead of making a new role for the webserver. 

## Learnings

I learned how to give permissions and I learned a bit better how a role works.
