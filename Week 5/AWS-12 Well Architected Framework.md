# AWS-12 Well Architected Framework
With this exercise I learned what the WAF means and what the pillars are of the Framework. 

## Key terminology
- the Well Architected Framework (WAF): AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads. Built around six pillars—operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability—AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs. The way you set up your IT or your application, the architecture, is a big part of how your application runs, how secure it is, and how much it costs. To help design architectures, AWS has the Well Architected Framework (WAF, not to be confused with the Web Application Firewall).

A simple way to remember the six pillars are CROPSS:

Cost Optimization Pillar: The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. Key topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.

Reliability Pillar: The reliability pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements.

Operational Excellence Pillar: The operational excellence pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems, and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.

Performance Efficiency Pillar: The performance efficiency pillar focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. Key topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve.

Security Pillar: The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.

Sustainability Pillar: The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts.

### Overcome challenges
- None really, just had to search for the right pillars and understad what they all mean. 

### Results
- See the key terminology for the study part and the youtube link.
