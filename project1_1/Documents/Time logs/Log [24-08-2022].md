## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I spent the whole day troubleshooting because my code still doesn't work, made the architecture for v1.1.

## Obstacles

I couldn't figure out what is wrong with the code and I doubted about some thing for the diagram.

## Solutions

I didn't found the right solution today, but asked shikha for help, she will help tomorrow. My code does work on the PC of Archana, so that very weird.

## Learnings

I learned that the actual code probably isn't the problem.
