## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I updated the NACL's, SG's and made sure that the instances are deployed in the right subnets.

## Obstacles

After I did this, I still had a bad gateway error and I couldn't connect to my webserver. 

## Solutions

I didn't found the right solution today, I will work further on it tommorrow. 

## Learnings

I learned that after adjusting the SG's and NACL's the ALB still doesn't work, so I have to look at the ALB itself and the target groups tommorow.
