## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I finally figured out what the problem with the code was, management to create a working code, made an architecture, almost completed the documents.

## Obstacles

In the beginning, I still didn't know what was wrong with the code. Managed to fix it in the end.

## Solutions

It turned out that my code was actually working all the way. The user data file was corrupted, (I didn't got any error) and when I removed the userdata file and replaced it with the same commands but in a different file, it worked!!

## Learnings

I learned that sometimes there are bugs which you can't fixed quickly by yourself. I spent a whole week fixing this problem but in the end it turned out my code was allright.
