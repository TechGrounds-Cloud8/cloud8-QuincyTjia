## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I made sure the Jiira was up to date for version 1.1, made a list with the new requirements, made sure the webserver is deployed in a private subnet. 
 
## Obstacles

I didn't know why I couldn't connect to the webserver via the adminserver anymore.

## Solutions

I think it has to do with the routingtables, so I have to update them tomorrow.

## Learnings

I learned what version 1.1 of the project will be and how to make private subnets in a VPC via cdk.
