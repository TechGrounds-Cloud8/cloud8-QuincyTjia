# AWS-12 Well Architected Framework
With this exercise I learned what the WAF means and what the pillars are of the Framework. 

## Key terminology
- the Well Architected Framework (WAF): AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads. Built around six pillars—operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability—AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs. The way you set up your IT or your application, the architecture, is a big part of how your application runs, how secure it is, and how much it costs. To help design architectures, AWS has the Well Architected Framework (WAF, not to be confused with the Web Application Firewall).

A simple way to remember the six pillars are CROPSS:

- Cost Optimization Pillar: The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. Key topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.

Best pratices:

    - Implement Cloud financial management
    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Measure overall eficiency
    - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
    - Analyze and attribute expenditure

- Reliability Pillar: The reliability pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements.

Best practices:

    - Automatically recover from failure
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation

- Operational Excellence Pillar: The operational excellence pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems, and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.

Best practices:

    - Perform operations as code
    - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    - Refine operations procedures frequently
    - Anticipate failure
    - Learn from all operational failures

- Performance Efficiency Pillar: The performance efficiency pillar focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. Key topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve.

Best practices:

    - Democrotize advanced technologies
    - Go global in minutes
    - Use serverless architectures
    - Experiment more often
    - Consider mechanical sympathy

- Security Pillar: The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.

Best practices:

    - Implement a strong indentity foundation
    - Enable traceability
    - Apply security at all layers
    - Automate security best practices
    - Protect data in transit and at rest
    - Keep people away from data
    - prepare for security events

- Sustainability Pillar: The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts. 

Best practices:

    - Optimize geographic placement of workloads for user locations
    - Optimize areas of code that consume the most time or resources
    - Optimize impact on customer devices and equipment
    - Implement a data classification policy
    - Use lifecycle policies to delete unnecessary data
    - Minimize data movement across networks
    - Optimize your use of GPUs
    - Adopt development and testing methods that allow rapid introduction of potential sustainability improvements
    - Increase the utilization of your build environments

### Overcome challenges
- None really, just had to search for the right pillars and understad what they all mean. 

### Results
- See the key terminology for the study part and the youtube link.
