    1. Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx): Normally you have to invest in new data centers or servers beforehand. You will spend money but don't know how it works yet and how you will use it. With cloud computing you don't have to invest a lot of money beforehand but you can pay only for the resources you consume. 

    2. Benefit from massive economies of scale: Because AWS is used by many users and companies around the world, it becomes cheaper to use for the consumers. It's a lot cheaper to use it in this way then on your own. 

    3. Stop guessing capacity: Normally with physical servers etc. you need to guess beforehand how much capacity you will need for the upcoming year or month. In this way you sometimes have paid to much for the capacity wich is used or you have to little capacity. You can't change this during this period, or if you do, it takes a lot of time. With cloud computing you can change the capacity whenever you need it and it takes only a few minutes. 

    4. Increase speed and agility: If you use physically servers etc. it takes a lot of time to implement new changes or updates. With cloud computing you can use new IT resources with just one click and use them straight away. This saves time and money for the company beacause you don't need to experiment yourself. 

    5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers: With cloud computing you don't need to spend money on a physical infrastructure (electricity, powering etc.). Instead you can focus on the customers of your company. 

    6. Go global in minutes: With cloud computing you can deploy a new application in just a few clicks worlwide. This means that you can provide  much better experience for you customers at a minimal cost.
