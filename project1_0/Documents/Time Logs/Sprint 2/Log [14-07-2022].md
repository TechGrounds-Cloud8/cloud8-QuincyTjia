## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I have created a S3 bucket where I can store bootstrap/post-deployment scripts and I made the code for automatically uploading a object into the bucket. 
 
## Obstacles

When I destroyed my stack, the S3 bucket wasn't automatically destroyed. I also cannot access my website so I have to fix that. 
 
## Solutions

I found out I needed to add a few extra lines of code to make sure the S3 bucket is automatically destroyed when you destroy the stack. 

## Learnings
I learned how to make a S3 bucket and how to make sure the userdata can be read from a S3 bucket. I also learned that you need to write down that you want to destroy a S3 bucket, if you don't it will be kept.
