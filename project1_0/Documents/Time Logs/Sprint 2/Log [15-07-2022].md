## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I have worked on making an IAM role for the webserver so that the user data from the S3 bucket can be executed. 
 
## Obstacles

I didn't know why the webserver didn't worked and couldn't find the right solution.

## Solutions

I found out I needed to make an IAM role for the webserver with some help from Ben.

## Learnings

I learned that you need to give permissions (role) for an instance if you want to use objects from a S3 bucket when you use a public IP address.
