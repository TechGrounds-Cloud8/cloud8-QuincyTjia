## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I added the SG for the Management server and I made the code for the NACL's in both the VPC's.
 
## Obstacles

After I added the NACL for the webserver VPC, I couldn't access my webserver (website) anymore.
 
## Solutions

I found out I needed to add a rule which allows inbound and outbound Ephemeral traffic.

## Learnings
I learned what ephemeral ports are and how to use them. I also learned how to code NACL's.
