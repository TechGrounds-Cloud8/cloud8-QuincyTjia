## Daily Report (1 sentence)

Today I finished the code for deploying the VPC's and make sure it worked.  
 
## Obstacles

I didn't know how to deploy a VPC in a different region. 
 
## Solutions

I searched a lot finding out how to get it working. Then I found out with some help from my teammate that I was thinking in the wrong direction. Then I looked a bit better at the architecture and I found out you don't need to deploy a VPC in a different region.  

## Learnings
I learned that I have to look more critical at the architecture.
