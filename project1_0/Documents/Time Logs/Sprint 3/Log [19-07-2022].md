## Daily Report (1 sentence)

I tried to figure out why a SSH connection from my home IP doesn't work and I added some NACL's.
 
## Obstacles

I don't know why I cant connect to the instance with my home IP. 
 
## Solutions

I changed some NACL's and it should work, I think it had to do with my home hotel network.

## Learnings

I learned that I needed also to allow inbound and outbound ephemeral traffic on the admin server subnets.
